<h3>Optional local API overview HTML</h3>

<p>
This particular overview is a shared HTML guide that can optionally be provided locally.  If you provide an
"overview" element with the local path of an HTML document in the local.json file provided in API explorer,
this overview will be displayed in a tab as the first thing a user sees when they open the API explorer.
